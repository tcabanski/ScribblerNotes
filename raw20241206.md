Recap:

The party investigated a haunting on the ship Rebecca, where they encountered undead creatures called ghasts and found a mysterious letter and dagger. They learned that Bruce's mother (and also the love of the captain's wife even though she was married to his friend, Bruce's father) was a ghost haunting the ship, and her ring was hidden on the ship. The party recovered the ring, which is revealed to have divination magic that can detect something specific at close range. They also discovered that the bruce's mother was not killed by the father, as previously believed, but by a doppelganger in Bruce's father's form sent by someone named Splinter. The party now has a lead to investigate a noble named Premil, who is being blackmailed by Splinter's sister, Blister.

Fun Moments

Blok's "gentle thoughts" had the group in stitches.

Narvi's over-the-top reaction to the ghasts' stench, complete with dramatic vomiting, provided a great comedic relief moment.

The group's confusion over the various names of the sisters - Blister, Splinter, Tyke, and Gargola - led to some amusing back-and-forth banter.

Narvi's eagerness to "slap Dorian" and his feud with the talented performer had the party laughing at his mischievous antics.

Bruce's deadpan delivery when he asked the captain if he could get a "bass" had the group cracking up.
