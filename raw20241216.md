Recap:

The party investigated a haunting on the ship Rebecca, where they encountered undead creatures called "guests" and found a mysterious letter and dagger. They learned that the captain's mother was a ghost haunting the ship, and her ring was hidden on the ship. The party recovered the ring, which is revealed to have divination magic that can detect something specific at close range. They also discovered that the captain's father was not killed by the mother, as previously believed, but by a doppelganger sent by someone named Splinter. The party now has a lead to investigate a noble named Premil, who is being blackmailed by Splinter's sister, Blister.

Fun Moments

Blok's "gentle thoughts" and his inability to properly use his abilities in combat had the group in stitches.

Narvi's over-the-top reaction to the ghasts' stench, complete with dramatic vomiting, provided a great comedic relief moment.

The group's confusion over the various names of the sisters - Blister, Splinter, Tyke, and Gargola - led to some amusing back-and-forth banter.

Narvi's eagerness to "slap Dorian" and his feud with the talented performer had the party laughing at his mischievous antics.

Bruce's deadpan delivery when he asked the captain if he could get a "bass" had the group cracking up.
