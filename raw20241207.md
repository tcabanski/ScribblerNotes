Fun Moments
Gird's confusion over the "whole bat thing about a bass" had the group in stitches.
Kaylessa's debate over Tong's comment about wanting a "bath" was a delightful moment of banter.
The group's reaction to Lady Jamandi's casual execution sentence for unrepentant bandits was priceless, with Gird wondering if they were supposed to kill them or give them rope.
Freiren's sarcastic taunting of the "iron weight Wraiths" adventuring group was a highlight, as she stuck her tongue out at them.
Tong's consideration of becoming a "mummy" dedication had the whole table laughing at the absurdity.
